# Slopr

Slopr is a CLI specialised to interact with the [slop.sh](https://api.slop.sh) API, written in Go to prioritise efficiency and stability so your uploads happen when you want them, not when JavaScript decides you can have them.

# Usage

It's genuinely the most simple piece of software I've ever used.

```
slopr /path/to/a/file
```

It's that simple. If you have a supported clipboard installed, the shareable link will be automatically copied to your clipboard. If not, you can manually copy it and share it with whoever you'd like.

Not that I think you'll need it, but you can always use the `--help` flag to view the usage, which will always be up to date.
